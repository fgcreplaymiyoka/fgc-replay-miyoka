# FGC Replay Miyoka üïπÔ∏è

FGC Replay Miyoka (Miyoka) is a fighting game replay server for the fighting game community (FGC).
You can host your Miyoka server to watch your replays from anywhere even if you're away from a console or PC.
It's open source and free.

Most of the fighting games allow you to watch replays in the game UI on a console or PC/Steam, but don't allow you to watch it from your mobile phones.
This interface is a bit counter-intuitive because:

- When you're playing a fighting game on a console or PC, you'd want to play something interactive like online matches or training mode. You are reluctant to watch replays because it's boring.
- If you don't watch replays, [you have no idea how you're _actually_ playing](#why-should-i-watch-my-replays), so you have no idea why you're losing in online matches, which is frustrating.

Miyoka's goal is to change this flow to:

- You watch your replays on your phone whenever you have time, like when you're commuting to the office üöã or during a lunch break üçΩÔ∏è.
- Ater a long day at work, you can play online matches right away because you already finished recapping your replays in daytime.
- You can effectively use your time.

In addition, Miyoka provides analytical insights on your playing style.
This helps you to figure out your habits or frequent patterns that might need to be corrected.

In short, Miyoka is an assistant to let you enjoy fighting games more than ever! üïπÔ∏è

## Why should I watch my replays?

Watching own replays is an essential part to improve your playing style in the fighting game.
Imagine you want to be a fasion model üï∫ but don't have a mirror ü™û to see how you actually look.
You show up in an audition with a confidence but the interviewers see you differently üòê.
You need to have time to see yourself _objectively_ with a mirror.

In the fighting game, the same principle applys. You need to have time to see how you actually played online matches, objectively.
So that you notice what's missing in your playing style.

## How should I watch my replays?

Here are the couple of advises:

- Find one common pattern that you believe it's the reason that you lost in matches. (e.g. "I got combos from jump attacks many times last night!")
- Make one objective that you believe you can achieve when you're playing the game (e.g. "I will focus on anti-air today.").
- Asking advises from advanced players or other fighting game forums is also helpful (e.g. "Is there any tips to make anti-air easier?")
- Don't try to fix everything at once! One step at a time.

In Miyoka, you can walk through different matches and rounds, quickly and productively.

## Your replays are private

By default, you are the only one who can access to your Miyoka server,
so that your replays are kept in private.
You have to set your unique password when you're setting up a new Miyoka server.

If you want to share your replays with a friend or a coach, you can download and share a replay with them or tell them the replay ID.
In addition, you can tell them your password for the short term access.
In this case, you should change your password after it's no longer necessary, so that your replays will be back to private again.
