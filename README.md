# FGC Replay Miyoka üïπÔ∏è

FGC Replay Miyoka (Miyoka) is a fighting game replay server for the fighting game community (FGC).
You can host your Miyoka server to watch your replays from anywhere even if you're away from a console or PC.
It's open source and free.

Most of the fighting games allow you to watch replays in the game UI on a console or PC/Steam, but don't allow you to watch it from your mobile phones.
This interface is a bit counter-intuitive because:

- When you're playing a fighting game on a console or PC, you'd want to play something interactive like online matches or training mode. You are reluctant to watch replays because it's boring.
- If you don't watch replays, [you have no idea how you're _actually_ playing](#why-should-i-watch-my-replays), so you have no idea why you're losing in online matches, which is frustrating.

Miyoka's goal is to change this flow to:

- You watch your replays on your phone whenever you have time, like when you're commuting to the office üöã or during a lunch break üçΩÔ∏è.
- Ater a long day at work, you can play online matches right away because you already finished recapping your replays in daytime.
- You can effectively use your time.

In short, Miyoka is an assistant to let you enjoy fighting games more than ever! üïπÔ∏è

## Your replays are private

By default, you are the only one who can access to your Miyoka server,
so that your replays are kept in private.
You have to set your unique password when you're setting up a new Miyoka server.

If you want to share your replays with a friend or a coach, you can download and share a replay with them or tell them the replay ID.
