# How to use Miyoka

## Why should I watch my replays?

Watching own replays is an essential part to improve your playing style in the fighting game.
Imagine you want to be a fasion model üï∫ but don't have a mirror ü™û to see how you actually look.
You show up in an audition with a confidence but the interviewers see you differently üòê.
You need to have time to see yourself _objectively_ with a mirror.

In the fighting game, the same principle applys. You need to have time to see how you actually played online matches, objectively.
So that you notice what's missing in your playing style.

## How should I watch my replays?

Here are the couple of advises:

- Find one common pattern that you believe it's the reason that you lost in matches. (e.g. "I got combos from jump attacks many times last night!")
- Make one objective that you believe you can achieve when you're playing the game (e.g. "I will focus on anti-air today.").
- Asking advises from advanced players or other fighting game forums is also helpful (e.g. "Is there any tips to make anti-air easier?")
- Don't try to fix everything at once! One step at a time.

In Miyoka, you can walk through different matches and rounds, quickly and productively.
