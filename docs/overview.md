# Overview

As a high-level concept, there are three basic components of Miyoka:

1. [Replay Uploader](docs/uploader.md) ... The program to upload your replays from a fighting game to a cloud storage.
1. [Replay Analyzer](docs/analyzer.md) ... The program to analyze your replays and create a dataset of replays. 
1. [Replay Viewer](docs/viewer.md) ... The program to view your replay through the dataset.
