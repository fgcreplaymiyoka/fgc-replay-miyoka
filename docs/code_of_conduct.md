# Code of Conduct

## Legal

While Miyoka aims to enhance the FGC experience, we emphasize the importance of adhering to legal and ethical standards. Before hosting a Miyoka server, you **MUST** ensure the following:

- Review and comply with the End-User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Use (ToU), and Terms of Service (ToS) provided by the game publisher or developer. If any Miyoka functionalities are prohibited, you cannot use them.
- Do **NOT** attack or humiliate any specific player. Replays typically involve two players—Player 1 and Player 2. Personally Identifiable Information (PII), such as player names, must be redacted unless explicit permission is obtained.

We are **NOT** responsible for any damages or legal actions that may arise from your use of Miyoka. We cannot provide legal advice. Use Miyoka at your own risk.
